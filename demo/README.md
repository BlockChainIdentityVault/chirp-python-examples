# Demo

This script sends out a random chirp, then continuously listens out for chirps.
It accepts a Chirp app key and secret as required parameters, you can retrieve
these from [developers.chirp.io](https://developers.chirp.io).

You can pass in a config file as an optional parameter with `-c <config_file`,
if one if not specified, the default configuration set in
[developers.chirp.io](https://developers.chirp.io) will be downloaded from the
network and used.

The script will print out the available audio i/o devices, and point to the
default audio devices. You may find that on some platforms you may find you need to
explicitly set the input/output device. Use the desired device index with the
`-i` and `-o` parameters accordingly to change devices.

There are also options to alter the block size and sample rate, however you
shouldn't need to use these.
